<p>Growing up, I’ve always been interested in games. Wii Sports, Webkinz, Minecraft, all the classics back in the early 2010s. But gaming never really crossed my mind as something that could turn into a job until I was 16, when I saw a playthrough of Doom Eternal. The smoothness, the mechanics, the graphics blew my mind, and that’s when I knew that I wanted to become a game developer.</p>

<p>I started to learn how to program, taking Computer Science courses through in high school to learn Python, and dabbling in HTML coding for fun. When COVID hit, the lockdowns pushed my boredom to the max but allowed me to further my creativity,  where I learned to code in vanilla Minecraft to customize my little town I was making! My love for the arts has also influenced my drive to develop games, both in visual and auditory forms. I enjoy learning about the process of media production, seeing how the little bits and pieces come together to create the finished product. I’ve also always had a love for music. I grew up playing piano, and played for 12 years before finally taking a break. I learned to produce and write music during COVID and am now learning to write soundtracks for games.</p>

<p>In 2022, I started my 4-year journey in undergraduate studies at Brock University’s Game Programming Program in collaboration with Niagara College. Through this program and my passion for game development, my dream to make games became reality, giving me the opportunity to work with professional game developers, learn industry standard development programs and make ideas come to life!</p>
